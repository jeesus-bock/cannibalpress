# Sebastian always work

And it is no fun at all. So, we've decided to make something special for his 30th birthday. A cake maybe, or a stripper, it remains to be decided. After years and years of hard work we think this is important. How can he be saved from what's coming. The sky isn't bright when the sun sets anymore. The time is a resource we do not have.
