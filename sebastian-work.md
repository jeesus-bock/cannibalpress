# Sebastian always works

And it is no fun at all. So, we've decided to make something special for his 30th birthday. A cake maybe, or a stripper, it remains to be decided. After years and years of hard work we think this is important. The scenery reminds me of a morgue. Then there's the question: How can he be saved from what's coming? The signs are all there if you know where to look, what to concentrate on. The sky isn't bright when the sun sets anymore. The time is a resource we do not have.

Every once in a while when the sun does shine just right, you can see a blink of living in the corner of his eye. Like a mirage, a miracle. Office hours wallow like burdened little things. Many a year ago there were no such thing. No pressure. Nothing to be cut in half for the benefit of the people. The same people who can not understand the westige.

- I've got the answer!
- I thought I had nothing.
- How far Can I take this without alerting them?
- Without artificial limitations paused indefinitely.
- With own volition or otherwise pushes.

As the wording gets reworded, his journey goes on and on. A bull making it's way to the drinking hole. I'm guessing some of the things previously said were exaggerated to some degree. He had his downtime. Watching old and new police series was his _thing_. Intro to inexplainable shenanigans. Boys club intervention on-going. Same dance in a wheel of victim and the suspect and the questions and the lies. Learning to control when to go tobed and fall asleep in midst of all things. Hardly an easy nut to crack.

Glass shapes reflect the light and filter it. This is the factory I've heard so much of. This he has to remember: all the gizmos illuminated by oscillating rainbows. There were toys and gym equipment and gardening tools and much more. Something you find in your average carage. But the most significan were the memorabilia: dozens of family vacation photos, yearbooks, little trophies accumulated over the years. So many years.

There were many kinds of watchers all around. His progress had not gone unnoticed. Pot-belly had had his eye on him almost from the beginning. The Siamese Tigers were on the scent too. Sent by the southern indonesian way-lords to search and observe his behaviour. Obedient little kitties unconditionally. Because of what he was, not what he does, the scent was strong. Like an airhorn screaming to the tigers ears. As unspicable as their skills were, they had been fooled a few times in the last few years. The Manager was maybe the worst. He didn't only want to view from a far but was eager to start puppeteering Sebastian. He wasn't content with anything less.

::: details

- Pot-belly Parkinson is an undead necromantic demi-god with the taste of human baby flesh. There isn't a chance he's not willing to take to get what he desires. One could describe him as evil, but he's actually just a very practical philosopher.
- Siamese Tigers is a duo of weretiger mercenaries or private detectives or secret agents, depending who you ask and what.
- Primordian Gatekeeper is one of the seven original gatekeepers (minus Cordiva Fungo). He's ill-tempered with a short fuse. This is actually something he's been trying to learn to control. Therapy and anti-depressants and othertype of drugs.
- Hudson, yet another P.I. on Sebastians case. He has contacts all over, the FBI and the CIA in the USA for instance.

Sebastian was a damn fine at his job. A paper-pusher, a bureaucrate. All of that but much more if you took the time to look closer. Everything was connected in this humungous fantastic machineryscape. He was a cog, but an important, very complex cog. A cog that had tons of cogs inside. And pipes and switches, moss-covered transistors. Dull, gray and beige on the outside, exciting but ominous, a little toxic on the inside. And speaking of insides, disembowelment isn't absolutely outside the picture, just less openly discussed phenomena. The atmosphere on the business parking lot was like a circus. Sweaty and weird lights again, calliope music so loud it makes you dizzy. There's a strong-man getting out of his small red Hyundai, big wide moustache and leotard. Sebastian's uniform wasn't as ostentatious or iconic. Just a cheap grey suit under a cheap darker grey trenchcoat. His tie wasn't grey, it was light blue and had yellow speech bubbles with the text "HELP!" in them. Maybe some sort of subconscious message one would think.

This Tuesday hadn't started great. A big client had a problem with some data accumulated by Sebastian. The analysts of Drug Corporation claimed to have found discrepacies in some of the additional number-flows in the documents. Variations for the born lucky. Estimates, mathematical hunches dressed as knowledge. But it wasn't Sebastian's job, just something he made a living doing. What am I doing in here, he often thinks to himself. It wasn't even clear whether or not it would've been better to send no data at all and leave the client empty handed. But Sebastian was a diligent person, both in work and private life. And he like being diligent. Being diligent, smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. Regular Camels and raw vodka were his favourites, especially the combination of the two. There he was, looming over a shot of Stolishnaya tons of papers spread out on the desk in front of him. The clock ticked slowly.

The the numbers started to make sense. A psychedelic cobweb of trails. Sebastian typed rapidly, slamming on the keys hard. Whatever it takes to keep it contained.

DRUG CORPORATION
Auxiliary development funds.
1.6 million USD missing from the main account.
Where did it go?
There's little to none documentation of the cash-flows regarding the Cayman islands accounts.
Multiple accounts opened and operated by shell corporations.
Tiramisu Scent Inc. seems to be in the thick of it.

A round drop of sweat emerged from his forehead and trickled into his eye. It itched a lot and Sebastian took the time to rub both of his eyes for a moment before continuing on typing the counterword. The air tasted like apricots, barely masking the smell of the booze. Mathison called from the invoicing departmen. Apparently the was something funny with the last billing cycle.

- _Are you there?_ Mathison asked when Sebastian took a longer pause to get his breath under control and have a big sip from his glass.
- _Yeah, I'm here and I positive I got the billing correct. I double checked and we were all good. It's the actual data that they claim is wrong and therefore unusable. I'm saying the data is good._
- _Well, what are we going to do now? The receivables department is up my ass for this._
- _I'm already working on regenerating the questionable data with more strict parameters. It shouldn't take longer than a day._

Data generation is like expressionist paintin. Throw up your feelings on the canvas. Put your state of mind into an image, picture. This eases the burden and cleanses your soul. One blemish in Sebastian's thinking was that he cares. Full weeks billed, although serices only rendered tuesdy to thursday. Isolating these inconsistencies wasn't as quick as he had hoped. Smoke curlies up towards the ceiling. Raindropa on the window. It was raining outside. The weatherman even promised some mild thunderstorms.
