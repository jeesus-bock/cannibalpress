# The philistines among us

Her cabbalah is spent on gematric misconfigurations and we are useless to her advancement. Beware of the dog when approaching her. Do not speak to her unless spoken to. Unification is but a dream. One that you don't want to wake up from. One of many dreams that actually mean something. Antibodies of the chaos are secreted during the sleep. Which means bad news for people who do not sleep. Imagine what a little sunshine or shoeshine could do to all the obscene obstacles on the journey through the mirror-life, otherlife of dreams. Black-out and forget what you regard unproductive, highlight what you see as positive or positive influence.

One summer solstice evening she went to a coffeeshop and stabbed herself multiple times with a fake trick-knife. She had bags of fake blood under her clothes and as the dagger hit, the deep red liquid sprayed all over the place and other customers. People were freaking the fuck out, screaming and running. Another mess to clean up for sure. She didn't have any friends. Maura next-door maybe, but not really. This was for a good reason though: she was what's considered crazy on many different levels, maybe all of the levels. And the blood-soaked coffeeshop debacle didn't help at all.

It was dark outside already and it was barely eight o'clock in the evening. Inside the house was dark too except for the room she was in. A circle of candles was set on the floor and she sat in the middle of it. 23 candles casting flickering shadows on the purple walls. Who paints their kitchen purple? Thr geomatry was definitely wrong. In front of her, peculiar fluids in a large bown started bubbling as she spoke the words of incantation. Her voice was serious and words firm, as they should when summoning creatures from other dimensions. Today the other dimension meant Hell and the occupant was a demon.

- _By the power vested in me by four of the four directions and the sign of pentagramaton I command thee: Appear in front of me and hear my words!_ Her face looked almost angry. The flames flickerd harder than before but stayed lit. Then a black entity appeared in the room.
- _Come to me and hear my plea!_ The woman continued demanding. Inconsistecies in the gematry manifest themselves by twisting and warping the black object.
