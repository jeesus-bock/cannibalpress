# The philistines among us

Her cabbalah is spent on gematric misconfigurations and we are useless to her advancement. Beware of the dog when approaching her. Do not speak to her unless spoken to. Unification is but a dream. One that you don't want to wake up from. One of many dreams that actually mean something. Antibodies of the chaos are secreted during the sleep. Which means bad news for people who do not sleep. Imagine what a little sunshine or shoeshine could do to all the obscene obstacles on the journey through the mirror-life, otherlife of dreams. Black-out and forget what you regard unproductive, highlight what you see as positive or positive influence.

One summer solstice evening she went to a coffeeshop and stabbed herself multiple times with a fake trick-knife. She had bags of fake blood under her clothes and as the dagger hit, the deep red liquid sprayed all over the place and other customers. People were freaking the fuck out, screaming and running. Another mess to clean up for sure. She didn't have any friends. Maura next-door maybe, but not really. This was for a good reason though: she was what's considered crazy on many different levels, maybe all of the levels. And the blood-soaked coffeeshop debacle didn't help at all.

It was dark outside already and it was barely eight o'clock in the evening. Inside the house was dark too except for the room she was in. A circle of candles was set on the floor and she sat in the middle of it. 23 candles casting flickering shadows on the purple walls. Who paints their kitchen purple?
