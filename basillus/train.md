# On-board the ride

## My synopsis

The tracks underneath make a sound. It smells in here, of old people. I'm ready to make a move, but where would I be moving? I don't have anybody to talk about databases with. I'm stuck thinking about thinking about languages. Impact, cold shunt. I almost spill my soda. it tastes like oranges. The person apologizes. _"No need!"_ I reply.

I lose the signal when the train enters a tunnel. Luckily there weren't that many tunnels around and I wasn't 100% dependant of the signal. Customs manifestations handed down by the metagarcs. Seventy five and counting.

## Quite the quiet observation

I read the screen of a man. He was investigating buy-and-sell boards for used cars. Maybe he is tired of taking the train, wants to take control. How could I possibly know his intentions besides lucky guesses? My mobile phone is almost out of juice. Time to reload, refresh as I slowly, but with great velocity, travel thru the steel veins of this country. I'm in no hurry. The ever changing scene is soothing, willowherb and lupine filled meadows in contrast to thick forests of pines and firs. Throw a birch or two in the mix and you have a show.

The next town is a prison town. Don't ask me how I know. Maybe an escape artist boards the train in disguise. I wouldn't mind the company! A fugitive, that would really be something. A black woman scolds here kid in a language I'm not familiar with. But a scolding it is I'm sure, the body language gives it away.
