In a very old castle in Prague the fumes of our labor were imminent. Crosschecking all the sources now. Beware of the mois creature right behind you. All the time, every day for the rest of your life. But be proud of  what we have accomplished here because it sets the eye of the reality askew. Volition or not, the will will be done. Taste of flesh in my mouth is overwhelming. It's my rotten teeth that give a bloody flavour. Nobody's choice but my own I'm afraid. Afraid of the dark inside us all. The burning sensation when you wake up in the noon. Exposed wounds throbbing and vailing. They're blaming us for many things, claiming we chose not to hand out the contact details of the Birch. We didn't have them for sure. I think.

Go with him or go not. Tires screeching, tires **screeching**. How convenient facade we have put up. Makes the appearances classy, high society. Secret tunnels lie beneath the castle. Dug directly in the bedrock, it's stony walls are cold to touch. Grey and dark, damp. Old habits die hard when wandering the old dungeons. We discovered them, the underground hallways and cathedrals and we entered them. But the crawlers already occupied the dark nooks everywhere. There's no escaping the shadow people. People made out of shadows so dark it drives you insane.

There were bizarre drawings and pictures on the walls depicting different weird creatures and objects. You'd need a flashlight or a gas lamp to illuminate them and the light seemed to bring the sights alive. Very hard to forget. The traitors and the heros. A story if you knew in which order to look at them. And we found graves, dozens of them, maybe hundreds if we kept looking. An next to them were the gardens. nsane plethora of different types of fungi.

We had plans and schemes and tricks to deal with the shadows. Some were working well, most of them not. But it didn't keep us from trying. Mother of all bless, we tried. Like it or not, we consumed the fungi, yellow and green and other colors. It opened a lot of eyes that could see different. We all, the boys and the girls and myself, were no soldiers but elusive exhibitionista. We wanted to be seen. We remember a blue t-shirt. The memory signature is strong, embedded into our brains through the optic nerve and other nerves.

The shirt rose suspicions, questions but it also provided reasons if we looked at ir right. The was an acronym printed on it: DSA. Sans serif font in bone white. What was the meaning of this? Digital Subscription Analogy? Diverse Secretive Agendas? I knew not who knew. We never thought about getting out. Not even when the going got rough. Black vipers scaling the cave walls, waiting in silence, yet whispering to us without sound. Calling us to do the unimaginable, undoable. Evil maybe. Or something almost. Sometimes we got tired of the sewers and climbed to the mountains. It was cold there but smelled real nice. Eventually though, each time we climbed back down and went to the dungeons again. It felt safer there,gi in the pitch black.

My good friend the Elastic Juggler did a small show. He danced on a table juggling full glasses of whiskey. He spilled none and it was wild. Indices of the eyelids conform to chaos. Apparent movement, firing in the cortex. Lightning bolts flying from person to person like human tesla coils. In the middle of it all I was wondering how long did I sleep that morning. It was past noon as I recall. I had cereal for breakfast and listened to some tunes on the vinyl player. Jazz something, it was soothing and calming. Not that I was very calm or anything, I never am when I wake up. Especially if I'm woken up like today.

Immature little beast suffocate us. Try to suffocate us, but our breath is strong. Stronger than the pressure around. Shadows are alive, alive. We all wanted to scream bloody death, but our empathy won in the end. All grief was paid for when the creatures finally contacted us. Step back, stepped back from the violence and greed. Only love and brotherhood were justified.

## _"We are sorry. Please forgive us."_

That's how the message rang in the tunnels. And forgive we did, plenty. Osmosis of talent and far-sightedness. It was a bliss for now. Everything changed again. My grandmother was in the hospital, weak and weary. While I was so alive. I decided to bring my granma some of the joys the tunnels provided: red moss for energy and light blue mold for feeling safe and warm. It was not going to be easy if we were still alive. Alive and kicking we were, shrouded by joy of our newfound allies. The abbatoir was filling up, feverishly. Nobody okayed this, we just floated in a general direction. And that direction was downwards.

We dug and we drilled. Not seeing daylight for weeks, months. The shroom energized us, shielded us from the heat and lack of oxygen. The dangerous fumes became healthy and invigorating. We got indoor plumbing, but there was a dead mosquito on the toilet seat. Where do all the mosquitos come from. This was worse than the northern forests during the summer or New Orleans. The stung us and the bite marks were swollen and itchy. Well, it was something you could live thru. We didn't only drill downwards, but discovered an acient cavescape when doing horizontal. Underground springs, like oases opened to cavrs the size of a house. Long winding tunnels you could get lost in a blink of an eye. And we pushed forward, making rockhard fact out of measly theories.

The ritual, infinite irk of intellectual humours, evaporating from the well of wellness. We inhaled the way to change a world. Meta-conscious issues marked resolved actually. None harboured the sad anymore, the angry or the vain. There were no leaders but a consensus where it mattered. We were still unique operators, even more so. Drinking the water just made us one in one sense. The dark creatures drank it too. It changed them from devilish to sarcastic and smug. It was hilarious. And we converged, all roads, tunnels, synaptic routes leading to one big bowl of inexplicable soup of feelings and physics. It was as much philosophical as it was biological. It was glue to all clues, an imaginary sudoku solved only by explicit co-operation.

Co-existence was hence painless. The shadows even took to the castle high above our heads. The shadows weren't all gloomy. Often they manifested as shadows of little critters, like squirrels and bunny rabbits, cats even. You could feed them shadows of peanuts and whatnot. Often they smelled of eucalyptus or something very similiar, not like death and industrial aerosols like when we first met with them. These days we were more aware of the permutations indoors, we understood the art, the message embedded within them.

## _"Ultimately let our atrophy wither."_

Generous, humane, altruistic. We were it all. Compensating for the past and maybe taking a little loan out of our future. Same difference afterwards. Crawlers crawling all around the hall walls. Stalagmites growing freely. Licking them brings mildly shocking tremors throughout the body, illumination, indication of effect and cause. Popping whistles, sounds organic. We communicate and grow, accomplishment in itself. The truth is coming close, towering over our small selves. In the eat of the night. I lay on the stone bed floor, it's warm and cozy. I feel like sleeping. Where we are. Circadian rythm'n'blues ringing all around.

Foreboding music in my dream. I went searching for them. Not because I was lonely. So many things made sense now. I zoomed into a post-apocalyptic horrorscape momentarily. Couldn't grasp anything. Little glowing rocks under my eyelids. They promised to explain what was happening. But it was happening so fast. Fasten your seatbelts, por favor. Out of touch in the crossroads. Where to next, none would say. So I rolled the dice and started walking to a direction. Maybe fate'll get me where I was meant to go. Not too long afterwards I met a world renowed painter Gustaf. We talked a good while. He gave me ponderable invigorating tips and tricks for creating images of the world around.

Devices were connected in a global network. We were the devices. Some of us were at least. I tried to break free but the alarm clock wokeme up from the sweet dreams. Indoors the signal was weaker and I managed to stand up. I wasn't naked I noticed, but I was somewhat confused and disoriented.
