# Kalashnikov wedding of the Thompsons

## Preface

Andy and mr. Burton chatting about this and that on mr. Burton's front lawn. Soft rockabilly music playing in the background.

- Andy: _Your guess is as good as mine!_
- Mr. Burton: _Watch it boy, you don't know where they've been!_
- Andy: _Relax, you understand what's on the line here. How awful can it be?_

Both turn to look at a shimmering crystal ball floating in the air at eye-height.

- Andy: _It is magnificient. And I truly believe it could free Mommy and Daddy from the inter-dimensional jailhouse. Keep watch while I try and activate the damn thing. How hard can it be: just touch it and speak the ancient words I got from the journal Daddy left behind before they were caught._
- Mr. Burton: _I thought we lost them the third of june last year, but maybe you're right: this thing might provide a way to contact them, even bring them back if we get lucky, but let's not toast yet. You don't want to end up like lady Jessica_
- Andy: _I don't have a bad feeling about it. Maybe it's the type of a game no mattter what you got, you win! Besides, lady Jessica was nothing more than a test subject for twist experiments dr. Raygub was doing, now was she?_

Excitement is apparent in the young boy's face. He enthusiastically reaches towards the ball. As his hand touches it, beam of glistening, gleaming light shoots out of the ball and engulfs the boy.

Twelve rooms, each painted with different color of the rainbow. The beam of light disintegrates the body of the boy, only to reintegrate it only moments later in room picked by seemingly random. He pants as he reappears. Walls are all green. Four walls with four doors leading to the unknown. He sits on a chair placed smack middle.

## Act 1

**A year and some weeks before - northern Nilesbury, California**

Daddy is watering the front lawn of a big red house when suddenly the stream of water slows down and then dies.

- Daddy: _Curse the gods for ever letting this piece of shit thing become existent!_
- Mommy: _Settle down my dear husband, it's only a hose of water, what is it to you who once commanded armies thousand heads in strength?_

Enter ninjas. Seven ninjas all dressed in black jump over the picket fence and surround Mommy and Daddy. Daddy pulls out a huge claymore that never leaves his side while Mommy produces two daggers made from **apocryptical amazon** steel. Weapons make sounds clashing against each other. Flesh is cut. One ninja loses his head and another one is sliced in half vertically.
