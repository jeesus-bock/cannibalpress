# Daddy the barbarian.

Enter Daddy the hairy werewolf-like barbarian with unspeakable bloodlust. Chaos reigns, the multi-billion dollar companies are set to fall when the vanity vanes. Our turmoil is unbearable.

Iescapable conundrums, first ones of their kind. Kinder than an old man in the stoplights. After all it is not only us who do the bidding, wreched from underneath the rocks of glory.

He opened his eyes to see a glorius sight. It welcomed him.His muscles grew threefold ripping thru his normal clothes. It got rid of the shredded clothes and dressed him up like the he-man he was. Deerskins and a helmet made out of skull of a horned demon. The deerskins felt good on him, safe like coming home. In his right hand was the battle-axe called Gigaslayer and the left held a big cup full of sweet mead that gets you drunk fast but tastes real bad.
