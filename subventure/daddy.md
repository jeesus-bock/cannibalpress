# Daddy the barbarian.

Enter Daddy the hairy wereful-like barbarian with unspeakable bloodlust. Chaos reigns, the multi-billion dollar companies are set to fall when the vanity vanes. Our turmoil is unbearable. The animals feed on the weak and strong alike. How long will it be before the pressure eases out. I know I do not know but don't know whether or not I want to find out. Iescapable conundrums, first ones of their kind. Kinder than an old man in the stoplights. After all it is not only us who do the bidding, wreched from underneath the rocks of glory. To be true is paramount.

The gardigan was purple, but the light made it look some else color, undescribable, uncodifiable. Alma Mater of destruction looming over everything and everyone. Especially the ones who aren't aware of the future intendations.
